# Car-Search-Project
My independent project to help me research the current auto market
## Summary
I have recently heard the news that the auto market is starting to significatnly change post pandemic years. Meanwhile my current car was getting old and I started to explore the idea of buying a new one. I noticed more and more youtube videos like this (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhmr8w-A7YQ) explaining that the car market got inflated during the COVID 19 pandemic and will soon pop. As a data analyst I couldnt take youtubers' word without seting my own research and analytics. Therefore I compiled thousands of auto listings from Cars.com and tracked the prices over time.
